I learned how to manage branches, resolve merge conflicts, and create annotated tags.
Some common mistakes I made were forgetting to use git add before committing my changes, and 
accidentally pushing to the wrong branch.
git checkout and git restore saved the day because those commands let me recover and fix my mistakes.
